## Why OpenClaw?

| Feature | ChatGPT | Copilot | OpenClaw + ClawPod |
|---------|:-------:|:-------:|:------------------:|
| Self-hosted | :x: | :x: | :white_check_mark: |
| Custom skills | :x: | Limited | :white_check_mark: Unlimited |
| Messaging platforms | Web only | IDE | Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp, Slack |
| Monthly cost | $20/user | $10/user | $29.9 flat |
| Your data stays yours | :x: | :x: | :white_check_mark: |

OpenClaw is an open-source AI agent framework. [ClawPod](https://clawpod.app?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=why-openclaw) handles hosting, so you get a production agent without managing infrastructure.

---

## Quick Start

### Option A: One-Click Deploy (recommended)

1. Pick a pack from the table above and click **Deploy**
2. Enter your bot token (Telegram, Discord, or other platform)
3. Your agent is live in 30 seconds at [clawpod.app](https://clawpod.app?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=quickstart)

No Docker, no VPS, no configuration files.

### Option B: Self-Host with OpenClaw

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clawpod-app/awesome-openclaw-agent-packs.git
cp -r awesome-openclaw-agent-packs/packs/sales/* ~/.openclaw/workspace/
openclaw gateway restart
```

Your agent reads `SOUL.md` on startup, loads skills from `skills/`, and starts working.

### Option C: Manual Setup

1. Copy any pack to your OpenClaw workspace directory
2. Configure API keys and MCP tools per `TOOLS.md`
3. Restart your agent

---

## How Skills Work

Skills are text-based workflow guides, not executable scripts. When a user asks "research Acme Corp", the agent:

1. Reads `skills/account-research/SKILL.md`
2. Follows the step-by-step workflow defined inside
3. Uses available tools (web search, MCP connectors) to execute
4. Returns structured output

Skills work standalone with web search. They get better when you connect MCP tools (CRM, email, calendar), but they're fully functional without them.
